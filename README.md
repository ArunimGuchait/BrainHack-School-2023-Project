# BrainHack School 2023 Project
**Multimodal Investigation of Neural Correlates of Athletic Performance**

## Short Description of the Project
The relationship between athletic performance and brain structure and function has been a topic of interest in the field of neuroscience. Understanding the neural correlates of athletic performance can provide valuable insights into the development of training programs and interventions to enhance physical and cognitive abilities. In this project, I propose to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), and FSL's Voxel-Based Morphometry (FSLVBM) to investigate the differences in grey matter volume and white matter connectivity between elite athletes and non-athletes. I will perform the analysis using Python-based tools, such as Nilearn and Dipy.  

## Goals of the Project
[1] Identify brain regions associated with athletic performance by comparing grey matter volume between elite athletes and non-athletes using fMRI and FSLVBM.

[2] Investigate white matter connectivity differences between elite athletes and non-athletes using dMRI and tractography analysis in Python.

[3] Explore the relationship between grey matter volume, white matter connectivity, and specific athletic skills (endurance, strength, agility). Goals of the project

## Data and Tools to Use
